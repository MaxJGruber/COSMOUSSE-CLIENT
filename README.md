COSMOUSSE is an inventory app of your best moments around a cold beer.

#Record!
Pin the map with every beer you enjoyed!

#“Fun Times!”
Keep track of the very best of memories by revisiting your inventory.

#Update
Update your logs based on renewed experiences (prices changes, change of mind, etc)

COSMOUSSE was created in MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) Stack, in 10 days, by ME alone, as a final project for my 
Web Development Bootcamp at Ironhack Paris.
